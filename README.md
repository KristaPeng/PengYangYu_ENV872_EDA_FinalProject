# PengYangYu_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject
This is the team repository for the group PengYangYu from Duke University ENV872 course. We are using R to solve real-world related research questions regarding the environment. In this project, we are focusing on the data of ozone concentration in North Carolina, US, from 2016 to 2022. We are eager to study the effect of location, seasons, daily AQI, etc. on ozone concentration using various analysis methods learned from the class.

# Database Information
<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

# Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 
The repository contains three folder in total.
1. Code folder
   The rmd files for data wrangling, data visualization, and data analysis can be found in this folder. We also included PDF files for those who have trouble reading rmd files. Each file was directly named after their main subject.
2. Data folder
   In this folder, we included three sub-folder. First, raw datasets that we find online as open resources were contained in the Raw folder. Second, after the process of data wrangling, we collected the data that could used in the project and summarised them into Processed folder. All the files under this two folders are in csv format. We also selected the data that could potentially used in spatial analysis to Spatial. 
3. Output folder
   In this folder, we collected the output image in data visulization and analysis part and each files are either in pdf or png format.
  
# Metadata
<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column. Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.> 

# Scripts and code

<list any software scripts/code contained in the repository and a description of their purpose.>

# Quality assurance/quality control

<describe any relevant QA/QC procedures taken with your data. Some ideas can be found here:>
